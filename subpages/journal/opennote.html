      <p> 8/24/24 Journey to the West (西遊記; Xīyóu Jì) is a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en. The novel is a legendary account of the pilgrimage of the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who journeyed to India in the 7th century AD to seek out and collect Buddhist scriptures (sūtras). The novel retains the broad outline of Xuanzang's own account, Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, but embellishes it with fictional fantasy elements from folk tales and the author's invention. The Buddha tasks the monk, whom the novel calls "Tang Sanzang" or "Tripitaka", with the journey to India and provides him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins: Sun Wukong (the "Monkey King"), Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing. Riding a mythical White Dragon Horse, the monk and his three protectors journey toward India and enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation. </p>
