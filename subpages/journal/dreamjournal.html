    <h4> dream journal </h4>
    <p> a record of some of my dreams. i dream a lot, and most of my dreams feel lucid </p>
    
    <h5> recent dreams </h5>
    
    <p> <strong> 7/27/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had a dream i was trying to put eye drops into my cat's eye, but i couldnt tell because there was a harsh light in my eye and i couldnt see earl's face. i remember holding here, and where i was it was bright, maybe outside. i remember getting mad that ******* turned off the ac, and i was sweaty and hot in my apartment. when i woke up, i was sweaty </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 7/24?/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had a dream i donated my high quality crafter weapons in ffxiv to the grand company mission turn in (they are penta melded or semi penta melded), the dream i was like in ffxiv for some of it, but i cant remember much else of what happened </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 6/28?/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> at one point in the dream i end up at a very dark and run down co-op house, like those near my college. before i got to the co-op, i was doing stuff before in the dream, but i dont remember where i was or who i was with. in the house, i remember walking in and it being just one floor, and when i walked in i turned to my right, and when i looked left i saw the main living room. across from the living room was another room, but dont remember what was inside, just the white doorframe. the lighting was dark, the color tones were dark purple, pink, blue, and green, and there was many dirty clothes piled onto the furniture. i didnt remember seeing anyone in the co-op but i was either with someone i was traveling with earlier in the dream, or i was thinking to myself while i was here. i remember the person i was with either telling me, or me telling them, or me remember that this place isnt safe, and that everyone that lived here made sure to hide and secure their computer ram, but i really mean their computer storage. i dont remember seeing any computers but i was thinking or hearing this mainly because the house didnt feel safe and often got broken into. i didnt go deeper into the house and left shortly after this. after i left i think i went somewhere else, then woke up </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 5/27/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> my memory is hazy it was a long dream but i only remember parts of it. i remember i had to do something or get something for someone. i remember being around a lot of people. i remember at one point im in a grocery store looking place but i was working on some gadget on a shelf. the ceiling is tall and dark in the building im in and i dont remember a lot of people nearby me. the shelf im in front of is a shelf at my waist height and it has some like some black orb thing, its on the shelf at the short side on a long grocery store aisle shelf. all of a sudden *** is behind me and either grabs me from behind or falls and hugs me from behind. his chest and ******** and ******** all ********* my body as i felt myself fall as he bumped into me, and i look over my right shoulder to look at him and hes smiling and looking at me. i ************** and look away, after that i dont remember much. i remember moving around a lot and didnt stay in one place </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 5/23/24 </strong> </p>
    <p>i was in ******* and it looked like i was visited for my *****************. i remember calling ******** that i was otw, but i accidentally call another ******** that ive never met but i assumed was with my family. i remember initially at the start of the movie i was in a hotel room coordinating and planning with my family. eventually we head to some big event, but its hot and sweaty so i leave suddenly to get changed. i head to some restaurant while im in ******** trying to head back to the hotel and it looks like ******* was driving us, parked in some walkway and we head in. eventually i get separated and im running around town trying to head to the ********. i remember frantically running to make it in time to court's event. the streets seemed familiar bc it felt and looked like i was in ****** ****** near campus and the streets are thw streets i lived in while i was there. i knew where to go but i felt like i was running out of time and getting lost. i remember at one point while im alone i get one of those cheap plastic drawstring bags from somewhere, i put it on and at one point later in the dream i put the leftovers from the restaurant i went to with my mom and my purse in there. <br> eventually i keep on running and end up in some suburban area that reminds me of the nicer neighborhoods in ******* bc its really flat ground, while ******* is hilly. i remember running into a couple that was also lost and in the samw area as me. sometime around this point or before im very lost and panicked, and end up looping from where i am, to where i was, eventually back towards this neighborhood. while  i initially was heading to the tower but i realized i had to actually head to the stadium once i realize i should be heading towards the stadium instead of the tower i felt way less lost. i remember seeing the tower and othee skyscrapers in the distance then the stadium. i find a barricaded walkway that headed to the stadium but thru a fancy shopping mall. it wasnt any of the shopping malls like in **********, it was very fancy fancy like neiman markus. i remember thinking i should have gotten *************** gifts here. i also remember either thinking this furniture would be good for my fam as we looked around and somehow some of them were there.  <br> i eventually get to the stadium and run into my family, there is so many people around me like commencement. i asked where ********* was and i turn around and hes there. k*******, c******, *** my **** ******** are there, and i think ******* and his *** is there (j******** and j***********). eventually its only me, c*******, ********, k*******, and j********** with us heading to our section. we follow kyle as he fast walks ahead of us, we get to some seating section with a lot of people, a small view of the football field (didnt look too long as i was trying to stay with my family), and tall ceilings that reminded me of inside the ut stadium section where ur getting snacks/restrooms/shops in the covered section of the stadium. we follow k******* up either up some stairs or towards some passage way in the back of this area away from the view of the field. as we head toward our section we find this scary weird escalator section that everyone around us just hopped on. it wasnt even an escalator if looked like creepy green on the side conveyor belts with black and dark grey belts. i hop on a belt after ******** and c******* and j**** pick the one next ro ours. k***** went ahead of all of us and was already waiting at the top. once i got to the top i had to jump off or else i would get stuck, i jumped and landed successfully and ran over to my family in front of me. the second floor was like a big walkway, almost like another level to the city like blame or that one chinese city. the sky was viewable from above and you can see people walking way down the street. eventually i wake up around this time slowly as i realized i was dreamin </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 5/6/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was somewhere naturey, it felt like a video game. i forgot </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 5/5/24  </strong> </p>
    <p> i was looking for a new apartment, got it; went in it, but someone was following me the entire time </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 3/29/24  </strong> </p>
    <p> it was a long dream that i kept on coming back to bc i kept on waking up. at first i was on some building with my friends from college with lots of rooms, one was a classroom i think. i don't remember exactly what we were doing but i was having fun, at one point in one of the classrooms i go to grab a snack and look through the cabinets in the classroom and open them up, it has like cereal in them, while i do this i think someone hugs me from behind. at one point we leave and we go and sit out on the street, the street is busy like ******* but i couldnt see exactly what all of the stores were. while we are sitting outside i see a guy walk up to us recording us, but he was only recording me basically. i confront the guy and take his phone away from him, get loud and mad asking why he is recording, and i delete the video of me on his phone. i can see the silhouette of me in the video but its distorted and grainy like a dream and i can only see my body's outline but i know its me (bc im cunty and hot and could see my curves). i either throw the phone far away into the crowd or i angrily give it back to him. around this time i either woke up and fell back asleep and my dream slightly changed. at one point i head to some resort or restaurant and we get there, i was with someone else, i think it was *******, as we rush to get to the restaurant before some other people i knew but i don't remember now. the area was beautiful like b********* ********* or a***********, and we parked and got out and walked down the street and it had pretty and tall buildings with rose and cream colored buildings and tall trees. there were cars on the street but i don't remember seeing any cars driving on the street, just the other group starting to get out of the car. maybe it was my friends or rivals, i think it was my friends. me and **********  get to the restaurant and its like some pub restaurant and me and ************t get a table assigned to us from the waitress. ********** shows up and picks another big table for us which is right in front of a family with only like 3 seats on one side. the table ****** picked transformed from a smaller table and when i looked back after lookin around the table either changed or ******* picked another table next to the one he picked which was more seats and more out of the way of the other family. i begin sitting down and looking around, around this time i wake up. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 3/5/24  </strong> </p>
    <p> i don't remember everything but i remember i was eating at some sort of resort or restaurant or vacation place and i was tasting the food, think i tasted beef roast before i woke up. i was eating with some old fat white dude, i was sitting across from him, i have no idea who he is but in the dream i knew him or was accustomed to him being there </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 2/10/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had a dream but it was hard to remember. i kept on waking up and falling asleep bc i was too hot and too cold, and my allergies were acting up. i remember returning to the same dream. it felt like a video game sometimes. i remember i saw ********* for some reason, i ran into her in a dark and distorted place as i was trying to find and protect someone. i don't remember if it was earl or a person i was trying to protect, i chased after them from a normal looking place into the distorted place, like we jumped into a tear and we fell into the distorted place. later on i was in a really old house at one point, and in a weird looking shower. i was with family? in a big house, there was old people. i went to shower in this old looking bathroom, but it was mainly the furnishing and decor that made it look old not like actually old. i remember taking a shower but the shower curtain looked weird with warm tones of dark red and green and gold and it had a design, and when i was in the tub the bathtub and shower area with the shower curtain made it look like a long hallway. the bathroom had a big window but i dont remember seeing anything outside - just warm bright light. the floor had carpet or a big bath rug. there was just one sink. it had a big mirror, reminds me of the big bathrooms in *********. it felt familiar but i knew i didnt live there. i was outside at one point, but the dream is hazy because i woke up so much. i think i thought it was ********** family's house, even though it looked nothing like the ******* house </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 2/2/24  </strong> </p>
    <p> hard to remember this dream. i remember i was walking barefoot on some concrete. i remember i was with a group of people i knew (but i didnt know them irl). </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 1/28/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had a weird dream abt pokemon or catching animals i think, and i was in a place that i thought i knew or had seen before. it was like a school, open hallways like my hs, but it was blue and looked older and looked like i had recognized it or been there before in a previous dream. it was only one story tall and had long flat roofs and blue poles. i was just passing by tho and went somewhere else. i had nostalgia and deja vu when i saw that school tho. i think i was in a forest/nature area one time. i remember being with people i knew or i ran into them but i cant remember. i think i was outside a house? i cant remember </p> 
    
    <p> <strong> 1/24/24 </strong> </p> 
    <p> i had a dream but i had to get ready for work quickly. i was fighting i think. i was laughing awkwardly at one point to protect myself. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 1/21?/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had dreams sometime between last journal entry and the next one, but i didnt write them down bc work or feeling bad. i remember one dream i was with ******** ********* and i was in a school like section. another part of the dream i was on a street that reminded me of a*********** suburb streets, i remember i either got into a car or was about to. it was really bright, i was on the left sidewalk looking down the street and there was only stores on my side of the street. i was going around to lots of different places, i felt like i was constantly moving. one area i kept on coming back to was the school section, it was like a big auditorium that was darkish and had lots of chairs. there was only chairs there and some students/people sitting, but majority of the chairs were empty. i was with the ************ ******** *** ****** in this auditorium, but i felt like i was either about to fight people or people were coming for me. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 1/14/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i had a dream but its hard to remember it. there was *******, i remember having a mission or i was trying to do something. i think i wanted to stream or i was about to stream or i did some streaming. i remember some parts of the dream felt weird or creepy or there was something creepy. i can't remember. i tried remembering when i woke up </p>
    
    <p> <strong> 1/13/24 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was at a school with *** ********* and it was like a free day or last day of school. i was dancing and saying hi to people and ******** by looking at people. xqc was in my dream, me and ******** found a place to go to which was will ferrel's house? but xqc and b******* were otw then me and my friends went inside. but then my friends transformed into ******* ** ****** i think and we explored will ferrels house. i explore the rooms and they are cozy but weird, no windows and i dont remember how i got out. think i got bored or woke up and left his house thru the front door. i left and found *******. one of them tried killing/betraying me earlier but i forgave them. we walk around i ******* and they are already smiling at me. im wearing a goth outfit then it sometimes switches to my white outfit with the white tank and skirt. i remember seeing a lot of students or people around our age walking around. i go up on some playground mulch tire thing and dance and wave to a group of ******* *** ******. then i think we either go to will ferrels house or we go to the restaurant. me and my friends try sticking together but have fun. eventually we end up at some restaurant trying to get food with friends, we have to go thru the back way thru the kitchen. the waiter *********** with me as he tries hiding nuggets in his pockets. me and my friends have to go thru the kitchen to get to our table, the chefs are watching us as i climb over the prep boxes. i climb over prep food ******** then i wake up. </p>

    <h5> older dreams </h5>
    <p> dreams i vividly remember but cant remember when i dreamed them. some are from when i was a young girl. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #1 </strong> </p>
    <p> first dream i remember is me in a dark hallway getting chased by glow in the dark dinosaurs. it was a loop dream, i would run down a long dark hallway and race to go into a bedroom and into a bed, which i thought was either my bedroom or my mom's. some loops i would make it to bed, some loops i would get caught by the dinosaurs. once i made it to bed or got caught i would restart at the same location at the end of the hall. i remember feeling the bed and it was really comfortable, it reminded me of my mom's bed growing up because it was really soft. when the dinos caught me i dont think it hurt, i was just really scared then i would restart the loop </p>

    <p> <strong> #2 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was in a giant square shaped building, it was dark and dim and was monochrome, all the walls and floors were white and the windows/empty areas pitch black or very dark. it was one giant square hallway with different rooms in the hallways, and stairs leading up and down between the hallways. one hallway was way higher than the starting area where i remember entering, and it would look down on a dark courtyard and i remember seeing monsters holding torches, reminded me of lizardmen but i cant remember exactly. i was with someone else and we would try jumping these guys to continue on, i remember we jumped one and then went to the next hallway. i dont remember anything important in any of the rooms, but i was very scared, alert, and tense in this building. eventually me and the person im with escape out the way we came and eventually lead back to an island. the scary building was on one island with a bunch of trees, and we ran to the beach and jumped onto a smaller sand island and jumped again and we were back "home", or it felt like home. we ran into our friends or family or people we knew and we felt safe and it was peaceful. i dont remember much after that </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #3 </strong> </p>
    <p> a circular lab in a desert looking area that i snuck into either to hide or look for someone, this wasnt where the dream started rather i ended up here </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #4 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was driving and it looks like the less populated roads of c********, like long roads with farm fields and sparse buildings - maybe lead from this dream to dream #3 above </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #5 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was in a place that looked like a***********, maybe downtown ********  but not really most likely a***********, and i pulled up to some triangle looking single floor building. i dont remember what the building was for but i tried getting in, i remember it being dark or night time when i tried getting in. i think i get in and its like an office but eventually i leave and i think i was nervous and on the run. i leave and either its daytime when i leave or when i get there. i remember the neighborhood was really nice, the triangle building was white i think and on the corner of an intersection, and there was like brooklyn style townhomes across the street. i remember the traffic lights were on a wire line instead of a pole i think. i remember it was pretty, i don't remember if i encountered anyone </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #6 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was at a school that looked like my hs, i was lost trying to find my classroom. at one point i find m********* room. either this dream or another seperate dream, i am still at school but it transforms into a evil murder school where the students get killed. i climb along the school's walls like a spider to avoid getting killed. before all the students were ordered to die i remember i was in a homeroom with a class full of classmates, i knew them but i dont know them irl. we had the desks lined up in groups, and i sat with a guy and maybe other people. the guy liked me and i liked him i think, and i remember looking out the window seeing flowers or the flowers were on a desk in a vase. it was a white flower with a green stem, it looked like a lily. eventually i leave the room and then it gets distorted and scary, and thats when it turns into a murder school. i remember i was either trying to find the front office or some sort of special room. i remember hearing students screaming as they are killed as i climb on the walls to avoid being killed or spotted </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #7 </strong> </p>
    <p> i was in a open mall trying to find a store. i dont remember if i make it to the store or not but i eventually leave and head to my car. the sky is very pretty during this time. the outside reminds me exactly of a***********, like those fancy suburbs a drive away from the campus. i find my car, which was my ****** at the time but i dont think it was my car in the dream, i think it was a ****** car. it starts raining in my car. i think during this time i think i forgot something so i either try go back to the store and look for it, or i sit and think abt it stressing before driving away. i dont remember what i did, but when i start driving it starts raining really hard. the streets remind me of a***********. i think i wake up around this time </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #8 </strong> </p>
    <p> either the dream above was a standalone dream or a branch off of this dream. i dreamed i was in college and walking around the apartments near campus, i walked to a building that reminded me of my apt senior year and ******* apartment building, it was like open air with concrete walkways, i remember entering the apartment to either go home or go to someone's house. eventually i either travel deeper into this apartment building, or i leave and enter a new one, i think i leave and enter a new one. before i leave i remember either being with ******** or with a guy i knew, i remember walking around the halls. i think there were students in the dream, but when i was walking around the hallways i think i was alone. eventually i leave and head to a new apt, it looks like the fancy on campus honor student apartments, but i think some frat had some relation to the buiding. i go in and its a really tight hallway and small elevators, it has the same vibe as the **** ******** *****, like brown wood, nice inside, i remember i think the colors inside being brown, green, red, and white. eventually i walk around and head to some big event hall or convention or conference and theres a lot of students there, but its also like a cosco with big shelves with pallets of snacks. there is snacks everywhere, i think in the apartment it leads to a snack room, then leads to the conference area. i remember walking around trying to pick the snacks i want. i remember theres big groups of students either sitting watching or doing something, and in different groups but i dont remember exactly bc i think i was hungry and wanted to look at all of the snacks. i remember at one point i go to the restroom and its a weird restroom, its one hallway with the bathroom entrance being in the middle of the hallway, and stalls to the left and right but i think the stalls were short. the far wall is a long mirror with sinks, i think i use the rr and i run either into a young white girl or a young white lady like my age. i either help them or talk to them before i leave, i dont think i was scared or nervous i think i was chilling. then i leave the bathroom and opens up into the main area of the conference, then i try to circle back to where i came from (snack room). i remember trying to avoid the big groups of students, and i take a different path otw back to the snack room with big bags of snacks. i look and decide on a bag and i take one, its like a popcorn or chip bag. i head to the snack room and i pick up either one small bag of candy or two, then i head back to the entrance. i remember either rushing or feeling rushed or like im running from something as i try to head out, but i don't remember anyone catching me or confronting me. i think i started rushing after i left the snack room. i zig zag and rush out of the apt and head out, and then this is around when i woke up. i don't remember if ********* was with me during this entire 2nd apt trip, or if i was alone </p>
    
    <p> <strong> #9 </strong> </p>
    <p> i remember i was in a massive version of the grocery store i grew up next to. it had a ice ring looking setup in the produce area, and it had a misty haze to the area. the ceilings were high and i remember everything was spaced out more </p>
