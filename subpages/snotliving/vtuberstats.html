    <h5> sneer's main abilities  <img src="../../gifs/cat120.png"> </h5>
    <p> <strong> snot command </strong> - sneer has the ability to command the snotballs. it takes sneer 5 seconds to cast the command spell, while she is chanting the spell she can be interupted. after a successful cast, sneer can summon snotballs to her location, absorb their power from afar, or transform snotballs into a weapon. when snot command is activated, sneer's auto attack will add a 5% chance to poison the opponent and +15 nature damage per hit. if a snotball is nearby while snot command is activated, sneer buffs their defense by +2 points and their crit chance by 5%. </p>
    <p> <strong> delirium </strong> - sneer has the ability to fall into delirium at will. delirium gives sneer a 10% increase to crit chance, 1% chance to stun the target, and 5% increase to physical damage dealt. however, sneer loses 5 health per 3 seconds, takes 5% increased physical damage, and takes 10% increased magical damage. effects last until delirium is canceled or stopped. </p>
    <p> <strong> immolate gambit </strong> - if sneer has physically touched an opponent and their health is below 50%, sneer has the ability to use immolate gambit. when immolate gambit is used, sneer latches onto the opponent with an slime grab, leaving the enemy stunned for 5 seconds. this grab and stun cannot be canceled or stopped. after 5 seconds sneer will then explode, killing herself, the latched opponent, and anyone 1 meter from the explosion point. </p>
    
    <h5> sneer's traits  <img src="../../gifs/cat120.png"> </h5>
    <p> <strong> power absorption </strong> - if sneer kills an enemy, she has the option to absorb their abilities or powers. if someone has just recently passed, sneer can also choose to absorb their ability - this only works if sneer has a bond with the passed individual. </p>
    <p> <strong> reanimation </strong> - if sneer is killed, she will reanimate in a random location with 75% of her health. this effect cannot be canceled or stopped. </p>
    <p> <strong> flight </strong> - sneer can fly due to her succubus wings. she can fly fast but not very high. </p>
    <p> <strong> snot control </strong> - sneer has passive control over all of the snotballs. she can mind control or telepathically communicate with any snotball within 50 miles. </p>
    <p> <strong> life drain </strong> - if sneer deals physical damage to an opponent, she heals for 5% of the physical damage dealt. this heal increases to 8% if the target is bleeding or poisoned. </p>
    <p> <strong> succubus charm </strong> - sneer has a 1% chance to seduce the opponent. if seduced, the opponent will be disorientated for 8 seconds and have their attack lowered by -2 points for 30 seconds.  </p>
    
    <h5> sneer's inventory  <img src="../../gifs/cat120.png"> </h5>
    <p> sneer's zweihander (main weapon): +2 strength, inflicts slashing physical damage to the opponent </p>
    <p> sneer's silver necklace: +2 strength, +1 physical defense </p>
    <p> lesser healing potion (quantity: 3): +15 health pts upon consumption </p>
    
    
    <h5> sneer's fighting style  <img src="../../gifs/cat120.png"> </h5>
    <p> sneer mainly attacks with her zweihander, but if disarmed she will attack using hand to hand combat. sneer has fast movement speed, but her weapon attacks take a moment to land due to the weapon's weight. sneer mainly fights on the ground in one on one combat, but can also choose to fly and use aerial attacks. sneer's main battle stratagem is to perform hit and run burst attacks, or use her evasion and speed to outmaneuver her opponent. </p>
